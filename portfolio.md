This is a brief, representative sample of my recent projects.
<br />
<br /><a href="/d6-system-roller/d6-system-roller.html">Progressive Web App Example - D6 System Roller</a>
<p>This is a Progressive Web App dice roller for a particular tabletop role-playing game. It's fully responsive, but more satisfying
with a touch screen. This was a personal project, and I use it when I don't feel like rolling and counting physical dice.</p>
<br />
<br /><a href="/monster-select/">React Library Example - OSR Monster Select</a>
<p>This is a React-based proof of concept app. I designed it to help amateur and freelance writers who were working on products
for certain old-school tabletop RPGs released under an open license. Basically, it's an easily-sorted list of classic monsters,
and they can be translated into 1970s-era stat lines with a click of a button, saving some reference and writing time. A public
release version would have more monsters and sorting options, but most of the groundwork has been done.</p>
