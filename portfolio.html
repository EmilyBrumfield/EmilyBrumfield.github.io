            This is a short, representative sample of my recent projects.
            <br />
            <br /><a href="/d6-system-roller/">Progressive Web App - D6 System Roller</a> --
            A Progressive Web App dice roller for a particular tabletop role-playing game. It's fully responsive and works well with touch screens.
            This was a personal project, and I use it when I don't feel like rolling and counting physical dice. (I'm doing intermittent
            work on the Service Worker and trying different approaches, so that portion of the app isn't always 100% functional.)
            </br />
            <br /><a href="/genesys-maker/">React - Genesys Assistant</a> --
            A React-based app to help calculate point costs for characters for a particular tabletop role-playing game. This
            is a personal project for a game system that I occasionally use, and it works best on desktops or large displays.
            I may eventually update it for public release, in which case I'd add a few export features and make it more
            responsive. I also used this to experiment with using simple gradients in ways that don't clash with text or
            look unprofessional and outdated, and I'm happy with the results.
            </br />
            <br /><a href="/monster-select/">React - OSR Monster Select</a> --
            A React-based proof of concept app. I designed it to help amateur and freelance writers who were working on products
            for certain old-school tabletop RPGs released under an open license. Basically, it's an easily-sorted list of classic monsters,
            and they can be translated into 1970s-era stat lines with a click of a button, saving some reference and writing time. A public
            release version would have more monsters and sorting options, but most of the groundwork has been done.           
            <br />
            <br /><a href="https://www.fantasyheartbreaker.com/AtBRoller/">Work For Hire - America the Bulletproof Roller</a> --
            The official dice roller for Rose Bailey's tabletop role-playing game, <i>America the Bulletproof</i>. It's based
            on my other rollers, but displays graphics for each die roll and has a slightly more complex dice select system.
